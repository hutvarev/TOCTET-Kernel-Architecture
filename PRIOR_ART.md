## Disclosed Concepts

- Phase-synchronous field execution model
- Bounded coherence range with micro-reset stabilization
- Topology operators as primary programming surface (rifts)

- MRT (multi-render-target) observability as first-class feature
- Field-native typography in dynamic SDF environments
- State-trajectory storage and playback (state player, not file player)
- Swarm synchronization via minimal phase anchor packets
- Boogie Woogie field programming language
- Robotics/swarm extension via field-driven control
