# Author Position and Scope
**TOCTET Kernel Architecture · Artem Hutvarev · 2026**

---

## Independent Research

TOCTET is the product of independent architectural research.
It was conceived and developed outside academic institutions,
without formal programming syntax knowledge,
through architectural reasoning applied to computational dynamics.

The author retains full intellectual ownership of the architecture,
its specifications, and derived works.

---

## Intended Applications

TOCTET is intended for use in:

- Computational research and experimentation
- Simulation and generative systems
- Creative technology and interactive media
- Musical and audiovisual instruments
- Robotics and swarm coordination (research context)
- Distributed systems with coherence requirements

---

## Boundaries

The author may decline participation in projects that apply TOCTET to:

- Weapons systems or military targeting
- Mass surveillance infrastructure
- Applications designed to deceive or harm individuals

This is a statement of the author's participation intent,
not a legal restriction on third-party use.
Legal formalization of usage boundaries will follow trademark registration.

## Note on Weapons

Physical uniqueness cannot be replicated with venture capital.
The author's position is that technology built from first principles
carries the responsibility of the builder — not just the user.

The author does not seek this responsibility through weapons development,
and will not accept it through coercion.
